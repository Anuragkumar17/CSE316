Intelligent CPU Scheduler Simulator

Description:
The Intelligent CPU Scheduler Simulator is a tool designed to simulate various CPU scheduling algorithms.It provides real-time visualizations of scheduling processes, allowing users to input process details such as arrival time, burst time and priority. simulator generates Gantt charts and calculates key performance metrics like average waiting time and turnaround time

Features

Support for multiple CPU scheduling algorithms:

First Come First Serve (FCFS): 
  This is the simplest scheduling algorithm where processes are executed in the exact order they arrive. 
It works like a queue, where the first process to enter is the first one to get executed. 
However, if a long process arrives first, smaller ones must wait, leading to high waiting times. 
This can cause the convoy effect, where short processes suffer delays. 
While easy to implement, it is not always the most efficient method for optimizing CPU utilization.
